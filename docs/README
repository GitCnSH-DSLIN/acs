Audio Components Suite (ACS)

ACS is an freeware crossplatform set of components designed to perform 
different sound-processing tasks. It supports reading the audio data from CD, 
different fileformats- wav, mp3, wma, ogg, mac and others, output to soundcard 
and files are sure also possible. Between input and output you can work with 
the data, different converters, mixers and processors are available.

Main characteristics are:
* Abstract Layer to include different "drivers"
  * Alsa, /dev/dsp, AOLive, OSS support within linux
  * DirectX, Wavemapper support within Windows
  * Audio playback and capture

    format with wide range of settings for compressiontweaks.
  * Monkey Audio format support (for Windows only)
  * CD-ROM playback and direct CDDA data capture
  * Append data to existing file/stream capability
* AudioMixer component for mixing/concatenating audio streams
